AI Connect-Four Engine

## Introduction

The **Machine4** engine is a *Connect-Four* game engine, which is built on the JAmuna machine learning library and JVision library. The engine also uses the **OpenCSV** library for some CSV reading/writing tasks. The engine is trained on hundreds and thousands of *Connect-Four* positions which are labeled for what is the best move in the position. The AI engine then starts to recognize the patterns found in the game until the AI reaches a strong playing level. The AI can only view the position from either red or yellow's perspective depending on the data that it is given. For our training set we use data from red's perspective; however, you can train the engine using data from yellow's perspective if you wish.

## Installation

To use this engine, you can simply download the code from this repository and use it in your projects as needed. The engine will download as a ```.zip``` file, which you can then extract into your desired location. The engine runs fairly quickly and we will be constantly making updates to the engine's playing ability by training it on more and more data. The hope is that the engine will reach a super-human level of playing ability. For more detailed information, you can take a look at the code inside of the repository. This engine is a test bed for what JAmuna can do in a fairly complicated task situation, even for a human.
